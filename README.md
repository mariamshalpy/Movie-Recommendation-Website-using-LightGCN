## Movie-Recommendation-Website-using-LightGCN-approach
In recent years, the use of machine learning in marketing has increased dramatically, bringing significant business benefits. Ultimately, it has become a significant factor in a business's success and development in terms of income and growth, as it assists in suggesting the right service to the appropriate people or groups. Graph Neural Networks are now widely employed, notably in Recommender Systems, enhancing their efficiency. In this project, we aim to implement a Graph Neural Network and a machine learning model called LightGCN, which uses user-item interaction graphs as input, representing movies as nodes and user ratings as edges. This unique approach enables the model to learn user and item embeddings through linear propagation on the graph, capturing detailed relationships for precise recommendations. Collaborative filtering recommends movies based on user data and similar user preferences. For the website front, the project will utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the front-end, while Flask will serve as the back-end, facilitating communication with the machine learning models. The main focus of the proposed methodology lies in implementing and comparing LightGCN and another collaborative filtering approach, evaluating their performance using precision and recall metrics, recommending top movies to users, and developing an interactive website for personalized recommendations. Here we are employing publicly available movie datasets for training and evaluation and constructing a functional and user-friendly recommendation website. Implemented movie recommendation using LightGCN. Evaluated against 5 CF methods called (Matrix Factorization (MF), Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) , Cosine Similarity, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Hybrid Recommendation System, emphasizing precision and recall. Created interactive website with HTML, CSS, JS, Flask for personalized recommendations, enhancing UX. Achieved 96% accuracy.
## Introduction
In the ever-evolving technology domain of today, Recommender Systems play a crucial role by providing personalized suggestions to users based on their preferences and behaviour. These advanced algorithms encompass various techniques such as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid models, enabling tailored recommendations across diverse platforms. A recommendation system is a type of software application or algorithm designed to provide personalized items, products, or content that users might find interesting, relevant, or useful based on their preferences and behavior. Whether it's e-commerce, Health Care, Education, streaming services, or social media, recommender systems contribute significantly to enhancing user experiences, increasing engagement, and driving business success in the real world. LightGCN (Light Graph Convolutional Network), leverages graph convolutional networks to capture intricate patterns in user behavior and deliver accurate, personalized movie suggestions while maintaining simplicity and competitive performance, while delivering accurate and personalized recommendations. Collaborative Filtering is a personalized recommendation approach that provides effective personalization based on user- item interactions, offering valuable insights into user preferences and behavior.
